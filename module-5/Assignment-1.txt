Virtual World Chat System

Objective: Create a chat system for social interactions within a virtual world.

Instructions:

Background:
Effective communication is vital within virtual worlds, as it enhances the sense of presence and community. In this assignment, students will develop a real-time chat system that enables avatars within a virtual world to interact with each other. The chat system should facilitate text communication, private messaging, and proximity-based chat, enhancing the social experience within the virtual environment.

Task:

Design and Development:

Assign students or groups the task of designing and implementing a virtual world chat system. They can choose a virtual environment created in Unity, Unreal Engine, or a similar platform.
Chat System Features:

Instruct students to implement the following features within their chat system:
Text Chat: Enable avatars to send text messages that are visible to nearby avatars.
Private Messaging: Implement a private messaging system that allows avatars to send messages to specific recipients.
Proximity-Based Chat: Create a proximity-based chat mechanism where avatars can only hear and see chat messages from nearby avatars. Avatars should experience the immersive effect of sound fading with distance.
User Interface: Design a user-friendly chat interface that integrates seamlessly into the virtual world environment. Avatars should be able to open and close the chat window as needed.
Notifications: Implement notification features that alert avatars when they receive new messages or private chat requests.
Documentation:

Require students to create clear and comprehensive documentation for their chat system. This documentation should include:
System architecture and design.
Instructions for users (avatars) on how to use the chat system.
A brief explanation of the implementation process and any key challenges faced.
Testing and Feedback:

Encourage students to test their chat system within the virtual world environment. They should use avatars to simulate interactions and gather feedback on usability and functionality.
Students can also seek feedback from their peers or conduct usability testing sessions with volunteers who navigate the virtual world.
Evaluation Criteria:
The Virtual World Chat System assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Functionality: The functionality and usability of the chat system, including text chat, private messaging, and proximity-based chat.
User Interface: The design and user-friendliness of the chat interface.
Documentation: The completeness and clarity of the documentation provided.
Testing and Feedback: The extent to which testing and feedback have been used to refine the chat system.
