Virtual Economy Simulation

Objective: Simulate a virtual economy within a metaverse.

Instructions:

Background:
Economies play a crucial role in virtual worlds and metaverse environments, affecting in-game currencies, assets, and player experiences. In this assignment, students will have the opportunity to design and simulate a virtual economy within their metaverse projects.

Task:

Virtual Economy Design:

Instruct students to design a virtual economy for their metaverse environment.
Encourage them to consider factors such as in-game currency, resource availability, and player-driven markets.
Economic Models and Systems:

Task students with implementing economic models and systems that govern the virtual economy.
Require them to consider supply and demand dynamics, as well as factors like production and consumption rates.
Marketplace Development:

Challenge students to create an in-world marketplace or trading system where virtual goods and assets can be bought and sold.
Instruct them to include features for setting prices, listing items, and conducting transactions.
Price Fluctuations and Events:

Encourage students to introduce price fluctuations and economic events that influence the virtual economy.
Examples may include limited-time sales, resource shortages, or special in-game events that impact prices.
Economic Analysis:

Instruct students to conduct an analysis of the virtual economy, considering factors like inflation, market stability, and player engagement.
Ask them to document the results of their analysis and any insights gained.
Adjustments and Balancing:

Challenge students to propose and implement adjustments or balance changes to the virtual economy based on their analysis.
Encourage them to iterate on their designs to create a more engaging and balanced economic system.
Documentation:

Require students to provide comprehensive documentation that explains the design, implementation, and analysis of the virtual economy.
Evaluation Criteria:
The Virtual Economy Simulation assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Economy Design: The creativity and complexity of the virtual economy design.
Economic Models: The accuracy and realism of the economic models and systems implemented.
Marketplace Functionality: The functionality and user-friendliness of the in-world marketplace.
Dynamic Events: The effectiveness of introducing price fluctuations and economic events.
Economic Analysis: The depth and insights gained from the economic analysis.
Adjustments and Balance: The effectiveness of proposed adjustments to enhance the virtual economy.
Documentation: The quality and completeness of the documentation provided.
