Themed Escape Room

Objective: Design and build a themed escape room within a virtual environment.

Instructions:

Background:
Escape rooms are popular real-world entertainment experiences where participants solve puzzles and riddles to "escape" from a themed room within a time limit. In this assignment, students will have the opportunity to translate this concept into a virtual environment by designing and building a themed escape room.

Task:

Theme Selection:

Instruct students to choose a specific theme for their escape room (e.g., ancient temple, haunted house, space station).
Emphasize the importance of selecting a theme that will create a captivating and immersive experience.
Puzzle and Challenge Design:

Challenge students to design a series of puzzles, challenges, and clues that are coherent with the chosen theme.
Encourage creativity in puzzle design, considering logic, observation, and teamwork as key elements.
Virtual Environment:

Task students with designing and building the virtual environment that represents the escape room.
Encourage them to use the chosen development platform (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine) to create detailed and immersive surroundings.
Implementation of Puzzles:

Instruct students to implement the puzzles and challenges within the virtual escape room.
Encourage them to use scripting and interactivity to ensure that puzzles respond to user interactions.
Clue System:

Challenge students to create a clue system that helps users progress through the escape room.
Consider incorporating both visual and auditory clues for a dynamic experience.
Time Limit and Completion:

Define a reasonable time limit for completing the escape room.
Ensure that students implement a mechanism to signal the successful completion of the room.
User Experience Testing:

Encourage students to conduct user experience testing with peers or volunteers to gather feedback on the escape room's difficulty, pacing, and overall fun factor.
Documentation:

Require students to document the entire development process, including theme selection, puzzle design, virtual environment creation, and user testing.
Encourage them to include screenshots or videos that showcase the escape room.
