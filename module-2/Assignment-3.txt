Interactive 3D Environment (Unity)

Objective: Develop hands-on experience in creating interactive 3D environments.

Instructions:

Background:
Creating interactive 3D environments is a core skill for metaverse developers. In this assignment, students will work with Unity to design and build a basic interactive 3D environment. This assignment encourages creativity and practical application of game development concepts.

Task:

Unity Environment Setup:

Instruct students to open Unity and create a new 3D project.
Encourage them to choose a project name and location, ensuring that they understand the Unity interface from the previous assignment.
Theme Selection:

Ask students to select a theme for their interactive 3D environment. The theme can be anything from a fantasy forest to a futuristic city, but it should allow for creative design and user interactions.
Design and Modeling:

Guide students in designing the layout and visual elements of their environment. Encourage them to think about the placement of 3D models, textures, and lighting to achieve the desired atmosphere.
Interactivity Implementation:

Instruct students to add interactivity to their environment using C# scripting in Unity. This can include interactive objects, triggers, or basic gameplay mechanics.
Encourage them to consider user interactions, such as picking up objects, opening doors, or triggering animations.
Testing and Iteration:

Emphasize the importance of testing their interactive 3D environment. Students should playtest their creation to identify and fix any issues or improvements needed.
Documentation:

Require students to create documentation that includes:
A brief description of their chosen theme.
A summary of the design and modeling choices they made.
An explanation of the interactivity added to the environment.
Any challenges faced during development and how they were resolved.
Screenshots or a video showcasing the interactive 3D environment.
Presentation:

Students will present their interactive 3D environments to the class, demonstrating the interactivity and explaining their design choices.
Submission:

Students should submit their Unity project files, including the documentation, through the course's online platform.
Evaluation Criteria:
The Interactive 3D Environment assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Creativity and Theme Execution: How well the chosen theme is executed and the creativity in design.

Interactivity: The quality and functionality of the interactive elements added.

Documentation: The completeness and clarity of the documentation, including challenges and solutions.

Presentation: The ability to effectively present and explain their interactive 3D environment.
