 Interactive Game Prototype (Unreal Engine)

Objective: Build a simple game prototype using Unreal Engine.

Instructions:

Background:
Creating interactive game prototypes is an important aspect of metaverse development. In this assignment, students using Unreal Engine will build a small game prototype. This task is designed to help them apply their knowledge of Unreal Engine's capabilities, including scripting with Blueprints.

Task:

Unreal Engine Setup:

Instruct students to open Unreal Engine and create a new project.
Encourage them to select the appropriate project template or settings for the type of game prototype they plan to create.
Game Concept Selection:

Ask students to choose a concept for their game prototype. It could be a platformer, puzzle game, or exploration-based experience.
The chosen concept should involve multiple interactive elements to showcase their Unreal Engine skills.
Blueprint Scripting:

Guide students to use Unreal Engine's Blueprints to script the necessary game mechanics.
Provide a list of mechanics or interactions they should include, such as character movement, object interactions, basic AI behavior, or simple puzzles.
Encourage them to apply event-based scripting to create responsive and interactive gameplay.
Level Design:

Instruct students to design a game level or environment that suits their chosen game concept.
Emphasize the importance of level layout, aesthetics, and usability in creating an engaging player experience.
Testing and Iteration:

Encourage students to thoroughly playtest their game prototype to identify and address any bugs, gameplay issues, or areas for improvement.
Documentation:

Require students to create documentation that includes:
A brief description of their game concept.
An overview of the implemented mechanics and interactions.
Details on how Blueprints were used to achieve the desired functionality.
Any challenges encountered during development and how they were resolved.
Screenshots or videos showcasing their game prototype.
Presentation:

Students will present their game prototypes to the class, demonstrating the gameplay and explaining their design and scripting choices.
Submission:

Students should submit their Unreal Engine project files, along with the documentation, through the course's online platform.
Evaluation Criteria:
The Interactive Game Prototype assignment in Unreal Engine will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Game Concept and Design: The creativity and effectiveness of the chosen game concept and level design.

Blueprint Scripting: The quality and functionality of the implemented mechanics and interactions using Blueprints.

Documentation: The completeness and clarity of the documentation, including challenges and solutions.

Presentation: The ability to effectively present and explain their game prototype.
