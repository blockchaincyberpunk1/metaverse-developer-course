Task:

Virtual Environment Setup:

Provide students with a virtual environment (e.g., a basic metaverse space created in Unity or Unreal Engine). Ensure that the environment is compatible with NFT integration.

Integration with Blockchain:

Guide students in integrating the NFT marketplace with a blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum) to manage NFT ownership and transactions.
User Experience Considerations:

Emphasize user experience (UX) principles. Students should ensure that the marketplace is user-friendly, easily navigable, and provides clear information about NFTs.
Testing and Debugging:

Instruct students to thoroughly test the NFT marketplace within the virtual environment to identify and fix any issues.
Documentation:

Require students to create comprehensive documentation that explains how to use the NFT marketplace, including navigation, buying, selling, and wallet management.
Presentation:

Ask students to present their NFT marketplace development to the class, demonstrating how it works within the virtual environment.
