Instructions:

Background:
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have gained significant attention for their role in representing unique digital assets within the metaverse. In this assignment, students will dive into the practical aspect of creating an NFT using a blockchain platform, providing them with hands-on experience in tokenizing a digital asset.

The significance of NFTs in the metaverse.
How NFTs can be used to represent and trade unique digital assets.
Potential applications of NFTs in virtual worlds or metaverse projects.
Submission:

Students should submit their documentation, including the NFT creation process and their reflection, through the course's online platform.
